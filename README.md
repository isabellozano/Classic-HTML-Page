# Classic-HTML-Page
# My Portfolio

* Hi everyone! So this is my first shot at a html page with css attached to it. It's not much.
* It is a basic page with a little navbar of some sort that includes a quick 'about me', that if you click, will take you to a new page where I wrote a very mini bio on my life these past 6 years. I also have * a portfolio page where I attached some images and some gifs to show where I will display my future work. I was having a bit of trouble with the positioning, wrapping and just overall formatting of my
* navigation bar on my header hence the very basic / simplistic look of it. My apologies, as it is not a sight for sore eyes or however the saying goes.

* So as far as installation goes, you need first and foremost Github; you need to download Visual Studio Code so you can write your code for HTML pages as well as your CSS and GitBash if you have Windows and   * Terminal for Mac owners because it makes it easier to commit, pull and push to your Github and locate your directories, etc. Those are just the main reasons/talking points.

* I did not collab on this with anyone, but I did get a lot of help to understand the concepts I was actually able to comprehend from fellow classmates, t.a's from the program I am attending and my instructor * as well as w3schools.com, on youtube it was mmtuts tutorials and freecodecamp!

* Again its not much, but I hope you enjoy my simple and easy to navigate portfolio html page! Thanks!
