        Hi there ladies and gents! Bienvenidos a mi pagina! My name is Isabel Gomez, I'm 24 years old and I was born and raised in Los Angeles, California. <P></P>
        
        I am first generation Mexican American as my parents hail from Mexico. <P></P>

        At the age of 18, after graduating high school, I ran off with a little circus called Cavalia Odysseo and I worked with them until I was 21. <p></p>

        I then came back to Los Angeles and started working at a middle school that was Math, Science and Technology based for a year and a half. <p></p>
        
        It was then that I knew it was time for me to start getting serious about pursuing my dream and career in development. <p></p>

        Some of my interests include watching and playing sports (baseball, hockey, soccer and softball) going to concerts, music festivals and travelling. <p></p>
        
        I hope to hone my skillset to become a web and game developer.

        </p>
